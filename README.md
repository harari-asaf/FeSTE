This is the official repo of the paper "Few-Shot Tabular Data Enrichment Using Fine-Tuned Transformer Architectures" 

Few-Shot Transformer based Enrichment (FeSTE), is a generic and robust framework for the enrichment of tabular datasets using unstructured data. By training over multiple datasets, our approach is able to develop generic models that can be applied to additional datasets with minimal training (i.e., few-shot). FeSTE based on an adaptation of BERT, for which we present a novel fine-tuning approach that reformulates the tuples of the datasets as sentences.
